The <code>JSON.stringify()<\/code> method in JavaScript is used to convert JavaScript objects or values to a JSON string. However, for the sake of this exercise, you&#8217;ll be building your own version to deepen your understanding of how data serialization works in JavaScript.<\/p>\n<p>Your function should be able to handle the following data types:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primitive types: Number, String, Boolean, null<\/li>\n<li>Complex types: Objects, Arrays<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note that unlike the native <code>JSON.stringify()<\/code>, your function does not need to worry about circular references, functions, or symbols.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples to illustrate what your function should do:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\r\nInput: ['foo', 'bar']\r\nOutput: '[\"foo\", \"bar\"]'\r\n\r\nInput: { name: 'John', age: 30, isEmployed: true }\r\nOutput: '{\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"isEmployed\": true}'\r\n\r\nInput: 42\r\nOutput: '42'\r\n\r\nInput: 'Hello, world!'\r\nOutput: '\"Hello, world!\"'\r\n\r\nInput: true\r\nOutput: 'true'\r\n\r\nInput: null\r\nOutput: 'null'\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Your implementation should correctly convert arrays and objects to their string representations, ensuring to wrap string values in double quotes and separate object properties with commas.

The items should be arranged such that they fill up the shortest column available, ensuring that the layout is balanced and the overall height of the grid is minimized.<\/p>\n<p>The implementation should include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A function to create a new DOM element for each item, setting its class, text content, width, and height.<\/li>\n<li>A function to calculate the position of each item and append it to the container, ensuring items are placed in the shortest column to achieve the Masonry effect.<\/li>\n<li>Consideration for the number of columns and the gap between items, dynamically adjusting the layout based on the container&#8217;s width.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre><code>const items = [\r\n    { content: 'Item 1', height: 150 },\r\n    { content: 'Item 2', height: 100 },\r\n    { content: 'Item 3', height: 120 },\r\n    \/\/ more items...\r\n];\r\n\r\n\/\/ Expected to create a Masonry layout with the given items inside a container with an id of 'masonry'.\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This task assesses your ability to manipulate the DOM using Vanilla JavaScript, handle dynamic layout calculations, and apply creative problem-solving to achieve complex layout patterns without external libraries.<\/p>\n",

The hierarchical structure of checkboxes can represent various real-world scenarios such as selecting features in a product, permissions in a software application, or categories in a content management system.<\/p>\n<p>For example, consider the following HTML structure:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Indeterminate Checkboxes&lt;\/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;li&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"tall\" id=\"tall\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;label for=\"tall\"&gt;Tall Things&lt;\/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;ul&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;\r\n                &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"tall-1\" id=\"tall-1\"&gt;\r\n                &lt;label for=\"tall-1\"&gt;Buildings&lt;\/label&gt;\r\n            &lt;\/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;li&gt;\r\n                &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"tall-2\" id=\"tall-2\"&gt;\r\n                &lt;label for=\"tall-2\"&gt;Giants&lt;\/label&gt;\r\n                &lt;ul&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"tall-2-1\" id=\"tall-2-1\"&gt;\r\n                        &lt;label for=\"tall-2-1\"&gt;Andre&lt;\/label&gt;\r\n                    &lt;\/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"tall-2-2\" id=\"tall-2-2\"&gt;\r\n                        &lt;label for=\"tall-2-2\"&gt;Paul Bunyan&lt;\/label&gt;\r\n                    &lt;\/li&gt;\r\n                &lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n            &lt;\/li&gt;\r\n            ...\r\n        &lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;\/li&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In this structure, selecting &#8220;Tall Things&#8221; should automatically select &#8220;Buildings,&#8221; &#8220;Giants,&#8221; and all nested options under &#8220;Giants.&#8221; Conversely, deselecting any child option should update the parent&#8217;s state to reflect that not all children are selected, thus showing the parent in an indeterminate state.<\/p>\n<p>This challenge requires a thoughtful approach to event handling and DOM traversal, ensuring that the state of each checkbox is accurately reflected throughout the hierarchy. As you work through this problem, consider the implications of each interaction, aiming for a solution that is both efficient and intuitive for the user.<\/p>\n",

As users type, the input field will automatically format the numbers into a readable format (e.g., <code>(123) 456-7890<\/code>), providing immediate feedback crucial for usability and allowing users to correct mistakes in real-time.<\/p>\n<h3>Validation and Error Handling<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to formatting, the parser will incorporate validation logic to confirm inputs adhere to a standard 10-digit phone number format, crucial for backend processing and frontend consistency, thus mitigating the risk of invalid data submissions.<\/p>\n<h3>User Interactions<\/h3>\n<p>The component will adeptly manage various user interactions. For example, when a user attempts to copy the phone number, only the digits (excluding formatting characters) will be copied to the clipboard, ensuring phone numbers are usable in diverse contexts without necessitating additional formatting.<\/p>\n<h3>Technical Approach<\/h3>\n<p>React&#8217;s <code>useState<\/code> and <code>useEffect<\/code> hooks will be employed for state management and side effects, respectively. Functions like <code>cleanNumber<\/code> will strip out non-numeric characters for consistent storage, while <code>formatPhoneNumber<\/code> will enhance displayed value readability.<\/p>\n<h3>Validation Workflow<\/h3>\n<p>The <code>validateInput<\/code> function will encapsulate validation logic, checking for completeness and format correctness, thus maintaining form integrity and guiding user inputs.<\/p>\n",

This array is eventually returned, containing all elements that matched the selector.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a step-by-step breakdown of the function&#8217;s logic:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Initialize an empty array <code>elements<\/code> to store the matching elements.<\/li>\n<li>Define a <code>traverse<\/code> function that will recursively explore each node in the DOM tree.\n<ul>\n<li>If the current node matches the provided CSS selector (using the <code>matches<\/code> method), it is added to the <code>elements<\/code> array.<\/li>\n<li>The <code>traverse<\/code> function is then called on each child node of the current node, allowing the function to search deeper into the DOM tree.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>The <code>traverse<\/code> function is initially called with the starting node, kicking off the recursive search.<\/li>\n<li>Once the entire tree has been explored, the <code>elements<\/code> array, now potentially populated with matching elements, is returned.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Usage Examples<\/h3>\n<p>The custom <code>querySelectorAll<\/code> function can be used in various scenarios, similar to the native method. Here are some examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To select all paragraph (<code>&lt;p&gt;<\/code>) elements within the document:\n<pre><code>const paragraphs = querySelectorAll('p');<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>To find all <code>&lt;div&gt;<\/code> elements within a specific container:\n<pre><code>const container = document.getElementById('container');\r\nconst divsInContainer = querySelectorAll('div', container);<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>To locate elements with a specific class within a container:\n<pre><code>const elementsWithClass = querySelectorAll('.my-class', container);<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Limitations and Considerations<\/h3>\n<p>While our simplified <code>querySelectorAll<\/code> function demonstrates the core concept of DOM traversal and element selection, it is not as optimized or feature-rich as the native implementation. The actual <code>querySelectorAll<\/code> method provided by browsers supports a wide range of CSS selectors and includes optimizations for performance. Therefore, our function serves as an educational tool to understand the underlying principles rather than a replacement for the native method.<\/p>\n<p>By building and understanding this simplified version of <code>querySelectorAll<\/code>, developers can gain insights into how DOM traversal works and how elements are programmatically selected and manipulated in web development.<\/p>\n",

The function should accept two arguments: the array to be flattened (<code>arr<\/code>) and the depth of flattening (<code>depth<\/code>). This challenge should be tackled using both recursive and iterative approaches to offer different strategies for achieving the same outcome.<\/p>\n<h3>Recursive Solution:<\/h3>\n<p>The recursive approach involves a function that calls itself to flatten each level of nested arrays until the specified depth is reached. If the current item is an array and the depth has not been exceeded, the function recursively flattens this item and concatenates the result. If the item is not an array or the depth has been exceeded, it is added directly to the result. This approach elegantly handles nested arrays by leveraging the call stack, but it&#8217;s essential to manage the depth to avoid excessive recursion that can lead to a stack overflow.<\/p>\n<h3>Iterative Solution:<\/h3>\n<p>The iterative approach uses a stack to manage the array items. Each item from the input array is processed: if it&#8217;s an array and the depth allows, its items are added to the stack to be processed; otherwise, the item is added to the results. This method iteratively deconstructs the nested arrays without recursion, making it robust for deeply nested structures but potentially more complex to implement and understand.<\/p>\n<h3>Example Usage:<\/h3>\n<p>Consider an array <code>[1, [2, [3, [4, 5]]], 6]<\/code> with a depth of 2. The expected output would be <code>[1, 2, 3, [4, 5], 6]<\/code>, flattening the array up to two levels deep but leaving any further nesting intact.<\/p>\n<p>This problem tests your ability to manipulate arrays, handle recursion, and implement iterative solutions, all crucial skills for a frontend developer.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n",

The challenge lies in ensuring that as the object is flattened, the keys in the resulting object are prefixed with their parent keys, joined by periods (&#8216;.&#8217;). This means that for every level of nesting within the original object, its key is concatenated with its parent key(s), creating a clear hierarchical representation of the original nested structure in the flattened object.<\/p>\n<p>This problem presents a common scenario in data manipulation, where nested structures need to be simplified for easier processing or storage, while still retaining a trace of their original hierarchical organization. Such a function can be particularly useful when dealing with configurations, translations, or any data that is naturally hierarchical but needs to be flattened for practical reasons.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example Usage:<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre><code>Input: { a: { b: { c: 1 }, d: 2 } }\r\nOutput: { \"a.b.c\": 1, \"a.d\": 2 }\r\n\r\nInput: { x: { y: 10, z: { w: 20 } } }\r\nOutput: { \"x.y\": 10, \"x.z.w\": 20 }\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In these examples, notice how each key in the output object is a string that represents the path to the corresponding value in the input object. The function essentially transforms the nested object into a &#8216;flat&#8217; object where each key-value pair is accessible at the top level, with keys indicating the original nested structure.<\/p>\n<p>Your implementation of <code>flattenWithPrefix<\/code> should work for objects of arbitrary depth and complexity, handling all the quirks of object iteration in JavaScript, such as inherited properties. The focus is not just on achieving the task but on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code that could be integrated into larger codebases.<\/p>\n",

                    "content": "<p>Write a function to flatten a multi-dimensional array into a single-level array. Provide both recursive and iterative solutions.<\/p>\n<p>The problem involves transforming an array that contains nested arrays of various levels into a single-level array. For example, given an input like <code>[[1, 2, [3]], 4]<\/code>, the expected output would be <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]<\/code>. This challenge must be addressed in two distinct manners:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recursive Approach:<\/strong> This method leverages the concept of recursion, where a function calls itself. When the function encounters an element that is an array, it calls itself with this nested array, accumulating all the elements into a single, flattened array. This approach elegantly navigates through the layers of nested arrays, extracting and combining elements into one cohesive structure.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Iterative Approach:<\/strong> Differing from recursion, the iterative solution utilizes a stack to manage and process the elements. This method iteratively examines each element, and when an array is encountered, its elements are added to the stack to be processed. This continues until all elements are flattened into a single array, ensuring efficient handling without the overhead of recursive function calls.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> Let&#8217;s illustrate the problem and solutions with a concrete example.<\/p>\n<pre><code>Input: [[1, 2, [3, [4, 5]]], 6]\r\n\r\nRecursive Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\r\nIterative Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This task not only tests your understanding of array manipulation but also evaluates your ability to implement solutions using different programming paradigms. Whether you opt for the elegance of recursion or the control of iteration, mastering this challenge will sharpen your problem-solving skills and prepare you for frontend interviews.<\/p>\n<p>As you embark on solving this problem, consider the implications of each approach, including the ease of implementation, efficiency, and potential limitations such as stack overflow in recursion for deeply nested arrays. Good luck!<\/p>\n",
